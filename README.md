# Multiple_Regression_Gene_Expression_Predictions
The goal of this coding project is to generate a simple regression model (that takes a single input to make a prediction) and compare its performance to a multiple regression model (that takes more than one input to make a prediction.) The models are built in the context of the input, gene expression of a gene familiy, and how it affects the output, effector gene expression. I expect that a regression model built with multiple gene expression inputs would more precisely predict the gene expression of an effector gene. The goal is test this code with existing gene expression repositories such as the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository.
